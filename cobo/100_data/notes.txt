Who the worst/best basketball players are

QCC
Why do you have to use a semi-colon rather than a colon when compiling with -classpath on a window's machine.


In-N-Out's CSV FLOW:
We can use regex to parse the CSV file by commas and white spaces, while storing the parsed data in corresponding arrays.


TRUBZ
javac-ing and java-ing with -classpath was very troublesome even with QAF assist.

Activity 1)
  1) github.com, piazza.com
  2) https://piazza.com/legal/privacy: piazza collects our data for registration information as well as our user profile information.
  3) Delimited: "having fixed boundaries or units". Data files are delimited because the do not contain infinite data.
  4) Look at the column label/header, which will make evident the type of data in the entire column.
  5) Music, basketball
  6) Who scored one 3 pointer in their entire NBA career: Shaquille O'Neal
  7) Datasets for how many 3 pointers were scored by individual NBA stars in different.
  8) https://www.nba.com/stats/players/ (we can also determine statistics based on rebounds and other factors)
  9) The data in the above site can impact the predictions of playoff brackets by artificial intelligence.
  10) The data was collected by recording in-game stats throughout this NBA season.
  11) Maybe Shaq doesn't want the fact that he only scored one 3 pointer throughout his whole career.

Activity 2)
  1) Name of object: Cereal
  2) n/a
  3) public class Cereal
  4) 15 instance variables
  5) String _name, String _type, int _cals, int _protein, int _fat, int _sodium, double _fiber, double _carbs, int _sugar, int _potassium, int _vitamins, int _shelf, double _weight, double _cups, double _rating
  8) We can get the calorie density per weight.
  9) What specific vitamins are in the cereal.
  10) More instance variables.

Activity 3)
  1) The temperature at Atlanta, Hartsfield - Jackson Atlanta International Airport, GA is 63.0F
  2) The temperature at (KATW)Appleton-Outagamie, WI is 48.0F
  3)  KATL: 72.0 degrees; Light Rain Fog/Mist (wind: 220 degrees)
      KSAV: 84.0 degrees; Mostly Cloudy (wind: 220 degrees)
      KATW: 48.0 degrees; Overcast and Windy (wind: 190 degrees)
      Colder at KATL
  4) There are 70 weather stations in Wisconsin.
  5) Filter by current temperature from the weather station.
  6) NSTU: Pago Pago, AS, Samoa
  7) We can also answer west/east-most territory.
  8) Almost none, we can copy and paste our southern-most code over.
