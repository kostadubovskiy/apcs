L09 -- Some Folks Call It A Charades(Celebrity)
2022-04-26
time spent: 1.0hrs

DISCO:
 * Files can be run from outside of their directory
 * GUI is a lot more complicated then it seems

QCC:
 * If the guesser only guesses the first name of the celebrity does that suffice?
 * How can we incorperate a "skip" method if the user decides they likely do not know who the celebrity is?
 * Why is the GUI not working?
