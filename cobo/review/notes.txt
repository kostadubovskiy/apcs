Activity One
   1. a) public static double sentimentVal( String word )
      b) The method requires a String parameter, and if not given one it will result in a compilation error.
      c) The method returns a double.

   2. Method Call               |     Return Value
      sentimentVal("happily");  |      2.32
      sentimentVal("terrible"); |      -3.38
      sentimentVal("cold");     |      -0.04
      sentimentVal("summer");   |      0.96
      sentimentVal("winter");   |      0.77

   3. a) compilable, takes string parameter returns double and assigns it
      b) not compilable, parameter should be a string
      c) not compilable, should take only one parameter

Activity Two
   4. Our totalSentiment method first converts our file to a string.
      Then it iterates through the string with a for loop and splices it by consecutive spaces into words.
      Then it removes the punctuation, and assesses the sentiment value of the current word.
      It adds that value of the current word to the total value tracker and moves onto the next word.
      Finally, it returns the total sentiment value. 
   5. a) The ratings usually make sense, however in negative 
         sentences, sometimes there are positive words like 
         “definitely” that can throw off the rating’s accuracy.
      b) Since a double negative would output a super negative 
         result in totalSentiment, this method could be adjusted 
         by testing for double negitives and making their values 
         positive (ex “not bad”). Also when a positive word is 
         next to a negative word this should make the score even 
         lower (ex: super bad). A method for implementation could be
         to multiply consecutive word values, so + then - yields - 
         whereas - then - yields +.
   6. This code will return 4 or 0 only, since all of the else if cases
      are logically covered under the first if statement.
      There is no universe in which totalSentiment < 15 is false
      yet totalSentiment < 10 is true. A fix for this would be to reverse
      the less than sign to a greater than sign.
