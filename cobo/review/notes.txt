Activity One
   1. a) public static double sentimentVal( String word )
      b) The method requires a String parameter, and if not given one it will result in a compilation error.
      c) The method returns a double.

   2. Method Call               |     Return Value
      sentimentVal("happily");  |      2.32
      sentimentVal("terrible"); |      -3.38
      sentimentVal("cold");     |      -0.04
      sentimentVal("summer");   |      0.96
      sentimentVal("winter");   |      0.77

   3. a) compilable, takes string parameter returns double and assigns it
      b) not compilable, parameter should be a string
      c) not compilable, should take only one parameter

Activity Two
   4. Our totalSentiment method first converts our file to a string.
      Then it iterates through the string with a for loop and splices it by consecutive spaces into words.
      Then it removes the punctuation, and assesses the sentiment value of the current word.
      It adds that value of the current word to the total value tracker and moves onto the next word.
      Finally, it returns the total sentiment value. 
   5. a) The ratings usually make sense, however in negative 
         sentences, sometimes there are positive words like 
         “definitely” that can throw off the rating’s accuracy.
      b) Since a double negative would output a super negative 
         result in totalSentiment, this method could be adjusted 
         by testing for double negitives and making their values 
         positive (ex “not bad”). Also when a positive word is 
         next to a negative word this should make the score even 
         lower (ex: super bad). A method for implementation could be
         to multiply consecutive word values, so + then - yields - 
         whereas - then - yields +.
   6. This code will return 4 or 0 only, since all of the else if cases
      are logically covered under the first if statement.
      There is no universe in which totalSentiment < 15 is false
      yet totalSentiment < 10 is true. A fix for this would be to reverse
      the less than sign to a greater than sign.

Activity Three
   3. indexOf returns the index of a specififed value in a String. Substring
       can cut up a string into parts starting and ending at a certain index,
       inclusive of the first index and exclusive of the last index. These methods
       can divide an existing String into 2 parts if you re-assign the old string that
       substring value. It is necessary to add 1 to the position of the space because of
       the *. 
   5. Calling a static method is specific to the instance of the class, and a non-static
       method can be called from another class.
   6. fakeReview could be modified to pick a random positive adjective or a random negitive
       adjective by calling those specific methods rather then the random adjective method.

Activity Four
   1. When competing companies want to make their competition look bad, 
      and they have bots autogenerate negative reviews on review websites.
   2. When a company wants to make itself look better on review websites.
   3. The method could retain the sentiment of the original adjectives,
      so negative adjectives would be replaces with negative and positive
      ones with positive. fakeReview could be modified to pick a random 
      positive adjective or a random negitive adjective by calling those 
      specific methods rather then the random adjective method.
   5. oneWord takes the value of the string starting from the second 
      character of oneWord.
   6. Because then the method, sentimentVal, that searches for the word 
      in the list of all adjectives would not be able to find the word.
   7. It could be modified to create a super positive or negative review
      by ensuring that the random adjective it is being replaced with
      has a sentimentVal with a greater magnitude.
