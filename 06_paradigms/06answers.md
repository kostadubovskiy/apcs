# Scheme
(display "Hello World!")

# Netlogo
print("Hello World!")

# Python
print("Hello World!")

Python and Netlogo seem to parse code by a hierarchy of function/method --> parenthesis/other syntax, whereas Scheme has the reverse hierarchy, and it differentiates methods and items solely by spacing.
